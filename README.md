Doxie Automator


This python service automatically retrieves scans on your Doxie Go or Doxie Q, places them in a directory on your computer.

This application is just a prototype at this point, and doesn't have any GUI. But you *can* run this application through a terminal if helpful. 

Feel free to add bugs or feature suggestions in the "issues" section.

To run:

0) Ensure you have virtualenv and pip installed

1) Clone this repository

3) Rename example.env to .env and update the DOXIE_USERNAME, DOXIE_PASSWORD and DOXIE_FOLDER

4) Create a virtual environment and install requirements with pip

5) Run "python main.py"
