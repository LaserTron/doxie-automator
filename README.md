Doxie Automator


This python service automatically retrieves scans on your Doxie Go or Doxie Q, converts them to OCR-enabled PDF, and uploads them to your python storage endpoint.

This application is just a prototype at this point, and doesn't have any GUI. But you *can* run this application through a terminal if helpful. 

Feel free to add bugs or feature suggestions in the "issues" section.

To run:

1) Rename example.env to .env and update the DOXIE_USERNAME and DOXIE_PASSWORD if applicable

2) Open a terminal window, navigate to this folder, and run "python main.py"
